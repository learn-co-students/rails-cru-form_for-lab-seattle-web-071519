# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# artist1 = Artist.create(name: "MJ", bio: "king of pop")
# artist2 = Artist.create(name: "Elvis", bio: "king of rock")
# artist3 = Artist.create(name: "Beyonce", bio: "queen b")
# artist4 = Artist.create(name: "Prince", bio: "formerly known as")
# genre1 = Genre.create(name: "pop")
# genre2 = Genre.create(name: "rock")
# genre3 = Genre.create(name: "rnb")
# songs1 = Song.create("artist1, genre1)
